# function-actors

A movement oriented function activity that will wake students up!

## Objective

Learning activity to help students learn or become more familiar with functions. Student in pairs or groups are given a function to act out. The function will consist of doing things like hop(), spin(), stretch(), jump()...etc. The other students will have to guess what their function looks like.

## General  
Notes | Expectations
--------|------------
Class Size | 4+,  
Instructors | 2+ (1 possible)
Prep Time | 20-30 minutes
Activity Time | 20-30 minutes
Noise Level | Moderate
Note | Students finishing too fast may have nothing to do! Spread out the skill level across groups if skill level range is wide.

## Preparation

Instructor should prepare the following:
* Different functions for each group printed out for the students to refer to. Depending on the level of the class, for loops and object methods can also be included!

Example:

```javascript
function func1() {
  hop();
  spin();
}
```

Students will then have to hop first, then spin.

## Activity

### Rules
* No inappropriate horseplay

### Arrangement

1. Form groups of students.
2. Give each group a function.
3. Set a timer (if needed) to give students a sense of urgency.

### On your Mark, Get Set, Go!   
1. Each group discusses how they will act out their function.

### Winner!
1. Once the timer is done (or all groups finished preparing), have students present their function one by one. Other groups watch and write down what they think the function is. The group with the correct one obtains points.
2. Do this for all of the groups. The group with the most points wins!

### Next Round
1. Another function!
